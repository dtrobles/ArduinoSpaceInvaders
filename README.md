Worked with an Arduino Uno to program LED displays for creating graphical representations of Space Invaders. By reading inputs from a potentiometer and a button, updates were made to an LED screen output, allowing players to manage and manipulate the game state in real-time.

Skills: C++, Arduino Uno, Embedded Systems
